rock outcrops (Kotýz\'s limestones, PRAG trace, Lower Devonian), the double ramparts of the Hallstatt hillfort are visible. \
There is also the ever-important so-called Leaky Cave, where finds of slate tablets with engraved symbols (non-Celtic) have been made, \
and it is the oldest manifestation of art in Bohemia, and many flint stones have been found here. \

that this is not an illogical deduction.",

He protects mountains and high places, for these are sacred areas. The Romans compared him to their supreme god, Jupiter. \
In our country, the so-called Taranis wheels - perhaps a symbol of the sun - are quite abundant in various locations. \
Later on, this symbol evolved into the well-known Celtic cross, but it is a \"mutant\" between the Taranis symbol \
and the classical Christian cross. Many people wear it around their necks thinking it is a purely Celtic thing, \
