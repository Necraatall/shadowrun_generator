	PSYCHÉ=(
		"Psyché",
		"According to legend, Psyche was the youngest and most beautiful of the three daughters of the Anatolian king. \
Her beauty aroused the jealousy of the goddess Aphrodite, who commanded her son Erotheus to use his arrow to arouse in the girl \
the love of the most repulsive of the men she would meet. Eros himself, however, fell in love with Psyche, \
threw the arrow into the sea, and when Psyche fell asleep he carried her off to his palace, \
where he visited her night after night under cover of darkness, warning her that she would lose him forever \
if she so much as glimpsed him. Psyche longed to visit her sisters, and Eros permitted her to do so; \
and Psyche, yielding to the importunities of her jealous sisters, lit a lamp at night to view her lover in its light. \
A drop of hot oil, however, fell on Eros' breast and awoke him; the god, angered by her disobedience, flew away. \
When the despairing Psyche discovered what she had done, she made a pilgrimage to the sanctuaries in search of her beloved, \
until she met Aphrodite. She pleaded with her to return her love to Eros; the angry goddess made this conditional \
on the completion of four tasks, which were, however, impossible for a mortal to conquer. \
Since Aphrodite, full of concern for her son, who had fallen ill because of the loss of Psyche, \
had lost some of her divine beauty, the maiden's fourth task was to descend to Mount Tartarus and ask the ruler of the underworld, \
Persephone, for some of her beauty, which she was to hide in a black box that Psyche was to guard and bring to Aphrodite. \
Psyche, concluding that the quickest way to the underworld was death, ascended the tower to throw herself down; \
but a mysterious voice intercepted her at the last moment and pointed the way to the underworld, \
advising her how to overcome the hellhound Kerber, the ferryman of the dead Charon, \
and other dangers that would lie in wait for her on her way to the underworld. \
Psyche wooed Kerber with barley cake and paid Chárón obolos to ferry her across the River Styx to Hades. \
On the way, she saw hands sticking out of the water; a voice told her to throw them another pie, but she refused. \
She then arrived at Persephone, who was willing to grant Aphrodite's request. On the way back, \
Psyche paid Charon once more and gave another pie to Kerber so that she could return. \
When Psyche left the underworld, she decided to open the box and take some beauty from it for herself, \
thinking that this would secure her Erato's love. Inside, however, was an eternal sleep that surprised and lulled her to sleep. \
Eros, who had already forgiven her, flew to her body and removed the sleep from her eyelids, \
begging both Zeus and Aphrodite for permission to marry Psyche. The gods agreed, Zeus gave Psyche immortality, \
and Aphrodite danced at their wedding. From the union of Eros and Psyche was born a daughter of extraordinary beauty, \
called by the name of Hedonē (ἡδονή, i.e., Delight, in Roman mythology Voluptas)."),
	ZEUS=("Zeus (Jupiter, jméno skloňováno Dia, Diovi...)"
	"Son of Kronos and Rhea, the supreme god. He was born in Crete in a cave in Mount Ida (other caves in Crete are sometimes mentioned). \
Here his mother kept him from his father, the titan Kronos, who, fearing the fulfilment of the prophecy \
that he would be overthrown by one of his sons, devoured all his sons immediately after birth. \
He fed on the milk of Amalthea (according to one version a goat, according to another a nymph) and honey from bees. \
When he grew up, he forced his father to give up his brothers and overthrew him after a ten-year struggle. \
He and his brothers then divided the rule of the world by lot."),
