class Gods_eg(Enum):
	AKER=("Aker", 
	"The earth god Aker was the personification of the eastern and western horizons, \
which represented the entrance and exit from the underworld. It often appeared in funerary texts and paintings. \
She was represented by two lions sitting back to back or a strip of land with a lion or human head at each end \
(one facing east and the other facing west)."),

	AMON=("Amon",
	"In the New Kingdom period, Amon gained the status of head of the pantheon. \
He acquired such importance mainly due to the success of the local Theban rulers, who, after a period of disruption, \
succeeded in reuniting Egypt and controlling the whole of it. The White Chapel of Pharaoh Senusret I at Karnak \
describes Amon as the \"king of the gods\". He also gained prominence by merging with the ancient sun god Heliopolis Reem, \
thus creating the deity Amon-Re. He was also associated with the fertility god Min - the god Amon-Min. \
The name Amon means \"Hidden\" and one of his nicknames was \"Mysterious in Form\" \
although he was usually depicted in human form wearing a crown with a pair of high feathers. \
He was also represented as a ram with horns pointing inwards towards his head. His consort was the vulture goddess Mut, \
and their offspring was the moon god Chonsu."),

	ANAT=("Anat",
	"The goddess of war Anat was supposed to protect the pharaoh in battle. \
Therefore, she was often depicted with a spear, javelin, and shield. Anat also wore a tall crown topped with feathers. \
She came from Syropalestine - she was the goddess of the Canaanites and Phoenicians. \
Anat is said to have been the sister or even wife of the supreme Phoenician god Baal. \
It is evidence that the Egyptians adopted the deities of surrounding peoples."),

	ANUP=("Anup",
	"Anup was the ancient god of embalming and cemeteries during the early days of the Old Kingdom, \
before he became the god of the dead, Osiris. Prayers were made to him for the transition of the deceased to the afterlife. \
Even later, he assisted in death sentences and accompanied the deceased to the throne of Osiris - for the ritual of weighing hearts. \
He was depicted as a jackal or a man with a jackal's head. \
The priests who prepared the bodies for burial wore jackal masks representing this god."),

	ASTARTE=("Astarte",
	"The goddess Astarte is very similar to the goddess Anat. She is also associated with war \
(especially with horses and war chariots), and prayers were made to her for the protection of the ruler in war. \
There is no mention of her cult in Egypt until the 18th Dynasty. She was usually depicted as a naked woman \
wearing an atef crown or with bull horns on her head, riding a horse. She was considered the wife of Sutekh and daughter of Rea or Ptah."),

	ATUM=("Atum",
	"Atum was a self-proclaimed creator god who rose from the primordial chaos of Num \
to form the primordial stump of the earth and give rise to the elements in the universe. \
As the head of the so-called Ennead (Nine Gods), he had the title \"Lord of the Sky's Boundaries\". \
His cult centre was Heliopolis. He was often associated with royal power, believed to carry dead rulers from the pyramids to the stars. \
Later, he became the protector of all the deceased on their journey to the afterlife."),

	BABA=("Baba",
	"The Egyptians believed that Baba killed people and fed on their entrails. \
Blh Baba was associated with aggression and masculinity - especially of rulers. It was believed that he could ward off the danger of snakes, \
control darkness and troubled waters. He was depicted as a baboon."),

	BASTET=("Bastet",
	"The goddess Bastet was the embodiment of refined femininity. Like any woman or cat in whose form she was depicted, \
Bastet's calmness hid an unsuspected temperament that could transform her into a fearsome creature. \
She was considered the protector of mankind. Originally a local deity, Bastet protected the city of Tell el-Basta in the north-eastern delta. \
As relations deepened between the different regions of the country, Bastet became better known as the \"Lady of the Two Lands\". \
The first shrine to the goddess Bastet was built in Tell el-Basta during the Old Kingdom under Pepi I, who dedicated a chapel to her. \
It was also of great importance during the reign of the 22nd Dynasty, who came from this city and also chose it as their residential city."),

	BES=("Bes",
	"Bes was a typical folk idol. However, he was not yet well known during the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom. \
His protective power began to be invoked by the people in the New Kingdom, but it was not until the Late Kingdom \
that he became a full-fledged deity and shrines began to be built to him. In the New Kingdom period, \
he was particularly popular with the artisans of Dér el-Medina. However, the earliest evidence of this lion-faced dwarf is rather disputed."),

	ESET=("Eset",
	"Like Hathor, Eset was a mother goddess specified as the mother of Horus - hence the king. The idea of Eset nursing Horus \
(especially discovered in bronze statues from the Late Roman and Greco-Roman periods) is reminiscent of Christian icons (mother and child). \
Eset was depicted with her head adorned with a throne or sun disc framed by cow horns. \
She was sometimes considered to be a personification of the throne. She was also often depicted with large protective wings. \
Eset was part of the Ennead at Heliopolis, and as the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus, she appears in the triad worshipped at Abydos (Abedi). \
Her most famous cult centre was on the island of Philae - on the southern border of Egypt near Aswan. \
Eset was closely associated with sorcery and magic. \
Myths often speak of her ability to heal and transform into whatever form she needed at the time. \
Eset had two important roles - she was the \"Great White Sow of Heliopolis\" and the \"Eset-cow\" \
who caused the birth of the holy bull Apis of Memphis (Mennofer). Her worship spread beyond Egypt to Syria, \
Palestine, Greece and throughout the Roman Empire, and she was venerated until the advent of Christianity..."),

	GEB=("Geb",
	"As the divine personification of the earth, Geb was the god of the harvest. \
Therefore, he was sometimes depicted in green with flowers growing from his body, \
but he was also often depicted lying under the bent body of the sky goddess Nut. \
In the creation myth of Heliopolis, Geb and Nut were the children of the god Shu and the goddess Tefnut. \
They were lovers who were forcibly separated by their father Shu (the god of air). Geb was also depicted in a human body, \
sometimes with an erect pyjid. Geb occasionally wore the red crown of Lower Egypt, \
but more often had his head decorated with a white goose. His daughter Eset may therefore have been described as a \"goose egg\". \
Like Shu, she too had a negative relationship with Geb, reflected in the funerary religion, \
where she was said to be able to trap the dead in their bodies. The earthquake was described as \"Geb\'s laughter."),

	HATHOR=("Hathor",
	"The mother goddess, Hathor, was associated with love, fertility, sexuality, music, dance, and alcohol. \
She was sometimes depicted entirely anthropomorphically, also in the shape of a cow or as a woman with cow horns. \
If she was depicted in a human body, she may have had her head adorned with cow horns framing a sun disc or a falcon \
perched on a necklace. She was also the goddess of the sky - she was thought to be a huge cow straddling the heavens, \
with her legs marked by four basic points. In various guises, Hathor was worshipped as \"Lady of the West\", \
\"Lady of the Western Mountains\", \"Lady of the City of Byblos\", \"Lady of Turquoise\" and \"Lady of Faience\". \
\"The West\" or \"Western Mountains\" corresponds to the sunset and, by analogy, the realm of the dead. \
Byblos was a port city on the Lebanese coast that was of great importance to Egyptian trade. \
It was a major importer of cedar wood, as Egypt did not grow trees suitable for building ships and large buildings. \
Like Eset, Hathor was considered the mother of the falcon god Horus and also the mother of the king (who was identified with Horus). \
Her name means \"House of Horus\". Interestingly, inscriptions in the Temple of Horus at Edfu mention Hathor's marriage to Horus. \
Hathor, in the form of a cow, is sometimes depicted nursing the king, who is very fond of such a diet. \
An example of this is the magnificent statue of the 18th Dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep II (c. 1427-1400 BC) found at Dér el-Bahri. \
The goddess Hathor was sometimes identified with the \"eye of Rea\", on other occasions she also appeared as the daughter of the sun god. \
The main cult centre of the goddess Hathor since the Old Kingdom was Dendera. It seems that the festivals at her number were rather debauched. \
The sign of her cult was the sistrum (rattlesnake), which was shaken during rituals. \
In Dendera, a temple dating back to the Greco-Roman period survives, dedicated to the triad of Hathor, Horus and Ihei - Hathor's son, \
rattling the sistrum in her honour."),

	HOR=(
		"Hor",
		"From the beginning of the dynastic period (approximately 3100 BC), the pharaoh was closely associated with Horus. \
He was represented as a falcon or a man with a falcon's head, and his ubiquitous symbol was the \"Eye of Horus\" (eye of the vijat). \
In one version of the Horus-Sutech rivalry myth, Horus had both eyes gouged out. In another version, he lost (and regained) only his left eye. \
In the form without both eyes Hor was associated with the moon, while in the form with the right eye he was associated with the sun. \
Because in both cases his sight was eventually healed, his eye became a symbol of healing (vedjat, literally \"whole\"). \
The eye was used as an amulet symbolizing strength and perfection, and also represented the waxing and waning of the moon. \
Hor's name means \"He who is above\" and stems from his title of sky god and the fact that Hor was depicted as a falcon that could fly very high. \
As \"Hor of the horizon\" he was called Harakhtey and in this concept he was merged with the sun deity Reem - Re-Harakhtey. \
From the Late Period (c. 747 BC) he appears in the form of the child Hor-pa-chered (the Greeks called him Harpocrates) \
on a stele known as the Horus cippus. He is usually depicted trampling crocodiles, strangling snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals. \
It is obvious that he was meant to be perceived as a child, as he was depicted naked, with a peculiar hairstyle known as \"curls of infancy\". \
Horus is said to have managed to survive various dangers as a young boy, so a ritual using his likeness was performed \
to protect children from similar dangers (or to cure snake bites and scorpion stings). \
The cippus (enchanted with a spell) was poured over water, thus imbuing the water with magical power, \
and then ritually drunk or applied to wounds. Hor was worshipped as part of the divine triad at the cult centre in Abydos (Abed). \
However, Hor is usually associated with the temple at Edfu (ancient Djeba), \
where he was worshipped as part of a triad with his wife Hathor and son Harsomtum. Hor was also closely associated with Hierankopolis \
(the \"Falcon City\", ancient Nechen) in the south and the city of Behdet in the Nile Delta. \"Hor of Behdet\" \
was represented as a winged sun disc."),

	HEH=("Heh", "Heh, the frog-headed god, was the personification of formlessness and infinity. His consort was the serpent-headed goddess Hehet. \
He was often depicted anthropomorphically holding a palm leaf in each hand (hieroglyph for year)."),

	CHEPRER=("Cheprer",
	"The god Cheprer (literally \"He who begins to exist\") was the creator and sun god. \
He was represented as a scarab - a dung beetle - or a man with the head of a dung beetle. \
Why the dung beetle was chosen to represent the creator and rising sun god is due to the activity of the beetle. \
He was observed rolling his eggs in dung and rolling them into a ball - this represented the sun. \
The Egyptians observed the hatched beetles emerging from the ball of dung and were reminded of the emergence of life \
from the primordial clod of earth, and so the dung beetles were considered capable of creating new life."),

	CHNUM=("Chnum",
	"Chnum was an ancient god who was depicted as a man with the head of a ram or in the form of a ram. \
The species of ram (Ovis longipes) used to represent him was the earliest species to be domesticated in Egypt \
- it had spiral horns growing horizontally from its head. The ancient Egyptian term for \"ram\" was ba, \
which was also a term for a principle related to the \"personhood\" of man (presumably the non-physical attributes \
that make human existence unique, or perhaps the moral nature of human motives and actions). \
Probably due to the ancient Egyptian penchant for puns, Chnum came to be regarded as the sun god Rea, \
and so this god was depicted with a ram's head sailing through the underworld on a sun barge. \
The dead man's ba was certainly more mobile than his ka (spirit). \
Chnum's status as creator god was linked to his role as a protective deity of the potters and his association with fertile soil, \
the annual Nile flood and the Nile cataracts. The main cult centre of Chnuma was located on the island of Elephantine \
at the first cataract on the southern border of Egypt. Another important temple dedicated to Chnuma was located at Esna. \
In this temple, his consort was the lion goddess Menhit, and it was here that the \"Feast of the Potter\'s Circle\" was also celebrated annually."),

	CHONSU=("Chonsu",
	"Chonsu was the son of Amon and Mut and was the god of the moon. His name means \"He who travels\", \
which is probably derived from the movement of the moon across the sky. In the Late Period, he was also the god of medicine. \
His main cult centre was Thebes (Veset)."),

	KUK=("Kuk",
	"This frog-headed god was the personification of darkness. His consort was the serpent-headed goddess Kauket."),
	MIN=("Min",
	"The fertility god Min was depicted as a partially mummified human. His left hand held an erect pipe, his right hand was raised. \
The typical head ornament was a pair of high lips. The signs of his cult were a bow and an unidentified object, \
perhaps a door stopper or a notched arrow, a shining lightning bolt or a pair of petrified shells. \
The god Min was a relatively ancient god and was also considered the protector of the mining area in the Eastern Desert. \
His main cult centres were Koptos and Achmim (Panopolis in Greek, because the Greeks identified their god Pan with Min). \
He was sometimes described as the son of Eseta, sometimes he was her husband, and Hor was their common son. \
By the time of the New Kingdom, he was identified with the Theban god Amon."),

	MUT=("Mut",
	"The goddess Mut was considered the wife of Amon and the mother of Chonsu. \
This divine mother was worshipped in Egypt especially during the New Kingdom period. \
Mut wore on her head a joint crown composed of the red crown of Lower Egypt and the white crown of Upper Egypt, \
which were set into each other. Sometimes she wore a headdress in the form of a vulture, \
whose two wings fell on either side of her face, while the head of a bird towered over the goddess's forehead. \
Mut was worshipped in the temple of Ptah at Memphis (Mennofer) and in a shrine at Giza. \
But she is especially famous for her temple at Karnak, which is adjacent to the south to the Temple of Amon."),

	NEFERTEM=("Nefertem",
	"Nefertho was associated with the lotus flower and depicted in male form with a blue lotus (Nymphaea Caerulea) on his head. \
A pair of feathers and two balances were sometimes also part of his head ornamentation. \
The Creation Myth of Hermopole Magna states that the sun arose from a primordial lotus flower. \
Nefertho was therefore closely associated with the sun god. \
Pyramid texts from the Old Kingdom period refer to Nefertem as the \"Lotus flower that is before the nose of Reus\". \
The title \"Protector of the Two Lands\" (Chener tawei) - thought of Upper and Lower Egypt \
- points to the universal importance of this god. Nefertem was worshipped in Memphis (Mennofer) \
as the son of Ptah and the lion goddess Sachmet, hence he was sometimes depicted with a lion's head. \
He was also sometimes considered to be the son of the cat goddess Bastet or, to make matters more complicated, \
the son of the cobra goddess Vajet of Butoh."),

	NEIT=("Neit",
	"Neit was an ancient goddess whose main cult center was Sais in the Nile Delta. \
Neit acquired special significance during the reign of the 26th Dynasty (664-525 BC) \
because Sais was then the home of the ruling family and the capital of all Egypt. \
Its attribute was a shield with crossed arrows, emphasizing its association with warfare (the Greeks later identified it with Athena)."),

	NEBTHET=("Nebthet",
	"Because of her association with Osiris, Nebthet was considered in late mythology to be the mother of Anup, \
the jackal-headed god of embalming. She was also the sister of Eseta, Usir and Sutekh (she was sometimes his wife). \
Nebthet seems to have been the assistant of her better-known sister Eset. Nebthet, like Eset, used to be depicted in human form, \
but could also be depicted as a hawk. Her name means \"Lady of the Pallas\" \
and her crown consisted of hieroglyphs for this nickname (a basket on the walls of a great house). \
Nebthet was associated with the head of the deceased or with the whole coffin (in association with Eseta at her feet. \
She was also one of the protective celestial deities - protecting Horus' son Hapi with the head of the baboon guarding the lungs of the dead."),

	NUN=("Nun",
	"The god Nun was the divine personification of the truths of chaos that preceded creation. \
He has been described as the \"Oldest Father\" and the \"Creator of mankind\". It was believed that when all was created, \
chaos continued to exist beyond the edges of the universe and in the underworld, and was the place of outcasts and demons. \
The perimeter walls of temples made of dried brick were sometimes built in undulating layers, the walls then giving an undulating impression. \
The aim was probably to mimic the waters of the Nun, as the temple was a symbol of the universe. \
Nun was also represented outside the temple in the form of a sacred lake. \
Nun could be depicted as a baboon, also with a frog's head or in human form with a beard. In the latter case, \
he was holding a sun barque above his head. His consort was the serpent-headed goddess Naunet."),

	NUT=("Nut",
	"The goddess Nut was the personification of the sky. According to the creation myth of Heliopolis, \
she was one of the children of Shu and Tefnut and the sister-wife of Geb, the earth god. \
The darkness of the night was explained by the fact that Nut swallowed the sun in the evening and gave birth to it at dawn, \
so that the sun spent the night hours wandering over her body. \
This idea was often depicted on the ceilings of tombs and on the undersides of sarcophagus lids. \
The Egyptians believed that Nut was the divine personification of the coffin and burial chamber. \
Because it gave birth to the sun every day, the dead could also be reborn from the coffin into the afterlife. \
The goddess Nut was usually depicted as a woman bent over the ground, but she could also be depicted as a cow. \
The \"Divine Cow\" was believed to carry the sun god Re on her back every morning."),

	OKO_REAS=("Oko Rea",
	"The eye of the sun god was separate and could act independently. In the Destruction of Mankind myth, \
she represents herself first as Hathor, later as Sachmet, a less threatening female divine force. \
The eye was also identified with the cobra goddess Vajet, one of the protective deities of kings, \
who appears on the front of royal head ornaments - erect and ready to spray poison on the king's enemies. \
This erect cobra is known as the ureus."),

	PTAH=("Ptah",
	"Ptah was the chief deity of Memphis (Mennofer), worshipped as part of a triad along with his wife, the lion goddess Sachmet, \
and the lotus god Nefertho. Later, Imhotep, the deified architect of the step pyramid complex of Djoser at Saqqara, \
was considered to be Ptah's son. As the chief creator god, Ptah was considered the patron of craftsmen, \
so he was an important figure in Dér el-Medina, the village of craftsmen who built tombs in the Valley of the Kings. \
In Memphis (Mennofer), the high priest of the cult of Ptah had the title of \"Great Overseer of the Craftsmen\". \
He was depicted in human, partly mummified form with a tight-fitting headdress. In his hand he held a staff consisting of a was \
- a scepter of power, a jeed - a pillar of stability and anch - a sign for life. Since the Middle Kingdom, \
Ptah has been depicted with a straight chin. In the Old Kingdom period, \
Ptah was associated with the Memphid funerary god with a falcon head, Sokar (Ptah-Sokar). \
In the Late Period, this deity became Ptah-Sokar-Usir. \
Wooden mummified falcon-headed statuettes were often placed in tombs as part of the funerary furnishings."),

	RE=("Re",
	"The ancient Egyptians had good reason to regard the sun as an important source of power, \
for a successful harvest was directly dependent on the sun and also on the annual Nile flood. \
The sun god Re was the most important sun god. The cult centre of the god Re was Heliopolis \
(called Luna by the ancient Egyptians, now a suburb of Cairo), where a very powerful priesthood held office. \
From the reign of the 4th Dynasty king Rajedef (c. 2566-2558 BC), another of the pharaoh's five names, \
the nickname \"Son of Reus\", was introduced to emphasize the king's identity with the god. \
The most important point of the cult of Reus was the obelisk or benben stone (derived from the verb weben - to dawn). \
In the myth of the Destruction of Mankind, Re is described with the bones, body and hair of an old man, \
but his divinity is obvious because his bones are silver, his body golden and his hair made of lapis lazuli \
(considered very valuable in Egypt because it was imported from as far away as Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan). \
The sun god Re was often depicted as a man with a ram's or falcon's head adorned with a sun disc. \
The Egyptians believed that during the twelve hours of daylight he traveled across the sky in a sun barque \
and at night he wandered through the realm of the underworld. In another myth of his nocturnal wanderings, \
he was supposedly swallowed by Nut, the goddess of the sky, and Re then traveled through her body, being reborn each morning. \
The sun god was omnipresent and very powerful. Through a process of merging, Re was connected to other deities such as Amon \
- (Amon-Re) and Horus - (Re-Harakhtey). Re may also have been identified with other gods; one of the texts on the walls of the tombs \
in the Valley of the Kings in the New Kingdom is called the \"Litany of Rea\" and here Re plays the same role as Osiris, the god of the dead."),

	SACHMET=("Sachmet",
	"The goddess Sachmet was a cruel manifestation of a goddess, whether Hathora, \
Bastet (the cat goddess of Búbastida in the Nile Delta) or the mother goddess Mut, in whose temple at Karnak, \
during the reign of Amenhotep III in the 18th Dynasty (c. 1390-1352 BC), there were a vast number of statues of Sachmet \
- it seems that one statue was designated for each day. Sachmet was associated with war and battle and helped kings defeat enemies. \
Her name literally means \"Strong\", so Sachmet was depicted as a lioness or a woman with the head of a lioness. \
She wore a sun disc on her head to indicate that she was the daughter of the sun god Rea. \
She was the wife of the creator Ptah and the mother of Nefertem, so she was a very important Memphid goddess."),

	SOBEK=("Sobek",
	"The crocodile god Sobek was depicted as a reptile or man with the head of a crocodile. \
He was worshipped in Fayyum and in the temple at Kom Ombo. Sobek was associated with pharaonic power and in the form of Sobek-Re \
was worshipped as a sun deity. Sobek's wife was Hathor and their child was considered to be Chonsu \
(everywhere referred to as the son of Amon and Mut)."),

	SOKAR=("Sokar",
	"The god Sokar was associated with the earth and crops, but sometimes also with death \
and the burial places of the capital city of Memphis (Mennofer). His association with burial led to his merger with Osiris, \
and because he was a prominent Memphid god, there was a further syncretization of the most prominent Memphid deity, Ptah-Sokar-Usira. \
Sokar's union with Ptah meant that he had the same wife, the lion goddess Sachmet. \
In the pyramid texts he is described as the creator of the king's bones. He was depicted as a mummified man, \
sometimes with a falcon's head. Wooden statuettes of him have been found in tombs along with many other funerary furnishings. \
The main cult centre of Sokar was Memphis (Mennofer). During festivals held in his honour, \
his worshippers wore braids of onions around their necks. The onion was used in embalming \
- its skins or whole heads were placed over the eyes or inserted into the ears or abdominal cavity."),

	SUTECH=("Sutech",
	"Sutech was Osiris' evil brother. He was a member of the Heliopolitan divine family and was associated with chaos, barrenness, \
and the desert. Rulers of the 19th and 20th dynasties derived their names from this god - for example, Sethi and Sutnacht. \
His worship acknowledged that chaos must have existed before order could exist. The main cult centre of Sutekh was Naqada in Upper Egypt. \
According to tradition, it was Nakada that was the site of his sudden birth from the goddess Nut. \
Sutech was depicted in the form of an animal whose identity cannot be precisely determined. \
It had a long curved beak, erect square ears, the body of a dog and a forked tail. \
He was also sometimes depicted as a man with an animal head. It may also have been depicted as a pig, a donkey or a hippopotamus \
- see the myth of the rivalry between Horus and Sutekh."),

	ŠU=("Šu",
	"The god Shu was the divine personification of air and sunshine. His name probably means \"He who ascends upwards\". \
The Egyptians believed he gave life to the sun each morning and protected it from the serpent demon of the underworld, \
Apopis, but he was also often associated with the moon gods Thoth and Chonsu. Although it seems unlikely, \
the god Shu was thought to be the leader of a pack of demons who threatened to torture the dead. \
Shu used to be depicted in human form with a feather n(a head, often standing between his descendants Geb and Nut, whom he protected. \
If associated with the Eye of Rea, he could also be depicted with a lion's head. He was especially worshipped at Leontopoli in the Nile Delta."),

	TEFNUT=("Tefnut",
	"The goddess Tefnut, one of the cosmic deities of Ennead, was the personification of moisture. \
Her husband (brother) Shu was the god of air and sunshine, and therefore Tefnut was associated with the moon. \
Like Shu, Tefunut may have been considered the \"Eye of Rea\", then she was depicted with a lion's head (and was worshipped in Leontopolis). \
She also appeared as an erect cobra... When depicted in human form, she wore a sun disc wrapped around a cobra."),

	THOVT=("Thovt",
	"The god of wisdom and scribes, Thovt, was depicted as a baboon, an ibis, or a man with the head of an ibis. \
He often figured in important processes such as the \"Weighing of Hearts\", which took place after death. \
He was closely associated with the moon and therefore wore a moon disc and crescent on his head. \
The cult centre of Thoth was Hermopole Magna in Central Egypt, where only two huge statues have survived, \
erected by the 18th Dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III. They are built from large blocks of quartzite, \
are 4.5 metres high without foundations and weigh around 35 tonnes each. During the Ptolemaic reign, Thovt was identified with the Greek Hermes."),

	TAURET=("Tauret",
	"The goddess Tauret was, along with the dwarf Bes, the most popular folk idol. \
She was embodied by the female hippopotamus, and her maternal and protective powers were invoked especially by the living and the dead."),

	USIR=("Usir",
	"Osir was the god of the dead and the afterlife as well as rebirth and harvest. \
He was depicted as a mummified man, often holding a crutch, reprimands, and his head adorned with an atheph crown. \
Osiris could have green or black skin, denoting fertility, or black Nile silt, or white skin (the colour of the linen bandages on mummies). \
One of his attributes was the jeed pillar, a symbol of stability equal to his backbone, \
and he was particularly revered at his cult centre of Búsiris in the Nile Delta. \
But Usir's main cult centre was the legendary burial site of Abydos (Abedja), \
where he was worshipped along with his sister and wife Eset and son Horus. \
Osiris was a member of the important Heliopolitan Ennead, which first appears in the pyramid texts of the Old Kingdom period \
- more specifically, during the 5th Dynasty."),

	VADŽE=("Vadžet"
	"The ancient goddess Vayet was almost always depicted as a cobra with the red crown of Lower Egypt. \
The Egyptians considered the cobra a symbol of sovereignty. She had her cult at Bhutto in the Nile Delta. \
Its name means \"the green one\" or \"she who belongs to papyrus\". \
Together with the vulture goddess Nehbet, she was believed to be the protector of kings.")
